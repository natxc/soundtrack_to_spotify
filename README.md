# Soundtrack To Spotify

I was enjoying company at a resturant. Each course was just as amazing as the conversations. But ... the music in the background was even more groovy. You know, the kind of tunes that make it impossible to focus on the person talking. You just wanna sing along and boogy!

Before leaving I asked the hostess what this playlist was called or if they knew what station was playing. "Oh, it's on Soundtrack, I think?" "Classy Brewery, maybe"

I must have this playlist. I remember some of the songs titles and I want them and all the others on a Spotify playlist. So here we are. Using Soundtrack's API and Spotify's to find the playlist, get the tracks, and create a playlist.

Enjoy!
